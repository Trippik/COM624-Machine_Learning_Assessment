<h1>Underlying Database</h1>
In order to allow for more rapid access and easy manipulation of data acquired through the Tiingo API, a MySQL database of the pulled data was created. 
Not only was this database used for development, but it also provides data for the final Flask Web App.
A Schema and Structure creation script is included above, however due to it's size, the full database dump could not be uploaded to GitHub, and is accessible via the Google Drive link below
